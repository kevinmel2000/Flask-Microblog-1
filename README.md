FLASK-MICROBLOG
---------------
Flask-Microblog is my simple project. Made with Python 3.5, Flask 0.11.1 and MongoDB 3.2.

I connect the Flask to MongoDB using the Flask-Pymongo 0.4.1.


SETUP
-----
I assume you are already installed on the computer MongoDB.
then create a database with the name `microblog` and user authentication with the name of `superadmin` and password `1234`.

after that make an virtual environment using virtualenv, name it `env`.
then install some dependencies using the `pip install -r requirements.txt` (without quotes).

setup has been complete.

RUNNING
-------
To run the application in the development web server just execute `run.py` with the Python interpreter from the flask virtual environment.
